We are going to create a angular 19 website.  Follow these guidelines for the new project:

1. Use Modular Architecture: Organize your application into smaller, manageable modules.
2. Implement Lazy Loading: Improve initial load time by loading features on demand.
3. Adopt Component-Based Architecture: Break your application into reusable, independent components.
4. Utilize Standalone Components: Take advantage of Angular 19's standalone components for simpler, more flexible code structure.
5. Apply Single Responsibility Principle: Ensure each component, service, and module has a single, well-defined purpose.
6. Implement State Management: Use a state management library for complex applications.
7. Use Reactive Forms: Leverage Angular's reactive forms for more robust form handling.
8. Follow Angular Style Guide: Adhere to official Angular coding style guidelines for consistency.
9. Optimize Performance: Implement Angular's built-in performance optimization techniques.
10. Implement Proper Error Handling: Create a centralized error handling mechanism.
11. Use TypeScript Features: Leverage TypeScript's strong typing and latest features.
12. Create Reusable Services: Develop services for shared business logic and data access.
13. Implement Proper Security Measures: Follow Angular's security best practices to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
14. Use Angular CLI: Utilize Angular CLI for consistent project structure and easier development.
15. Implement Proper Testing: Write unit tests and end-to-end tests for your components and services.
16. Use Zoneless change detection
17. Use Signal based forms
18. Use Material 3
