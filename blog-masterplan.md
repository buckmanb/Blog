```

### Key Technical Implementations

1. Angular Specific:
   - Standalone components
   - Zoneless change detection
   - Signal-based forms
   - Lazy loading for feature modules
   - State management for complex data flows

2. Firebase Integration:
   - Firestore for data storage
   - Firebase Authentication
   - Firebase Storage for media
   - Firebase Functions for backend operations

3. Performance Optimizations:
   - Image optimization pipeline
   - Lazy loading of images and content
   - Caching strategies
   - Progressive web app features

## Data Models

### User
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  displayName: string;
  photoURL?: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'author' | 'user';
  createdAt: timestamp;
  lastLogin: timestamp;
}
```

### Blog Post
```typescript
interface BlogPost {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  excerpt: string;
  authorId: string;
  status: 'draft' | 'published';
  featured: boolean;
  tags: string[];
  imageUrl: string;
  likes: number;
  views: number;
  createdAt: timestamp;
  updatedAt: timestamp;
  publishedAt?: timestamp;
}
```

### Comment
```typescript
interface Comment {
  id: string;
  postId: string;
  authorId: string;
  content: string;
  parentId?: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'flagged';
  createdAt: timestamp;
  updatedAt: timestamp;
}
```
